Repository for a latex dissertation template. Where text was used it came from Jane Austen's pride and prejudice on project gutenberg. See link: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342

The template was built by following the online overleaf tutorial: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/How_to_Write_a_Thesis_in_LaTeX_(Part_1):_Basic_Structure by Josh Cassidy

For those struggling with the bibliography the [TeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/ "TeX Stack Exchange") has many useful questions relating to this, look for tags `biblatex` and `biber`.
